# How to create a Reverse Proxy on your service
***
<Callout type="info" >
  A reverse proxy allows you to mask a service that is running under a port on your Minecraft server. This is most useful with plugins which use a port that users should access like Dynmap. It converts the URL from  `x.x.x.x:25678` to `my.domain.com`.

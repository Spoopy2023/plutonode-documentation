*More server versions are avaliable, this image was taken on a pre-production build of Andromeda*

Leave the `"Keep Files"` button un-toggle if you are just replacing the server software but are maintaining the same server version. ![Keep Server Files](../assets/versions-KF.png) <br/> However, if you are changing server version click the  `"Keep Files"`, it will become red and will read `"Delete Files"` ![Delete Server Files](../assets/versions-DF.png)

### Click the `"install"` button, this will open a context menu.  <br/>

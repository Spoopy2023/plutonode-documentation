<Callout type="info" emoji=" " >
  A reverse proxy allows you to mask a service that is running under a port on your Minecraft server. This is most useful with plugins which use a port that users should access like Dynmap. It converts the URL from  `x.x.x.x:25678` to `my.domain.com`.

  We do not advise users uncheck the `Auto Generate SSL certificate` toggle. If your service requires an SSL certificate and you have unchecked this option you will have to delete and re-create this reverse proxy.
